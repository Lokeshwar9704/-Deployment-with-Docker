# Dockerized Web Application

This repository provides an example of how to containerize a simple web application using Docker. Docker enables you to create isolated containers that bundle the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.

## Overview

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in isolated containers. Containers package an application along with all dependencies, making the app portable and consistent across different environments.

## Key Docker Concepts

1. **Images**: Immutable templates that define whatâ€™s in a container, including the app and its dependencies.
2. **Containers**: Running instances of images that operate as isolated processes.
3. **Dockerfile**: A script of instructions to build a Docker image.
4. **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and managing multi-container applications.

## Basic Workflow

1. **Write a Dockerfile**: Define the app dependencies, setup commands, and entry point.
2. **Build the Image**: Use `docker build -t <image-name> .` to create an image.
3. **Run a Container**: Use `docker run <image-name>` to start a container from the image.
4. **Manage Containers**: Start, stop, and remove containers with `docker start`, `docker stop`, and `docker rm`.

## Example: Simple Web Application

### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile specifies the Python environment, installs dependencies, and runs the app:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official lightweight Python image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application files
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
